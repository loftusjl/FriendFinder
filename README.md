# Friend Finder

Friend Finder is a full-stack web-app that will compare your survey results with those of 200 users and return the name and profile pic of the people who match your responses most closely!

## Getting Started

    * Please be patient. If no one has visited it recently it takes a second to spin up the server.
* Click "TAKE THE SURVEY!" and then on a scale of 1 to 5 rate how strongly you agree with the statements.
